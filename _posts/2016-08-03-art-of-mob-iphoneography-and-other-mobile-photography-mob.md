  As for the future of Art of Mob...I tried to continue on a limited basis this
  year but soon found myself blogging at nearly the pace I had in previous
  years. So, I'll be discontinuing posting new articles but will leave Art of
  Mob online as a resource for those interested in mobile photography.
